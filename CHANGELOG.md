- Added new blog post: **AI Idgit Chronicles I: The Math Ain't Mathing (OpenAI's Embarrassing Equation)**

## 2025-09-29: [v1.13] 🔐 Privacy Notice and more

### 💫 Content Updates
- Added the **Privacy Notice** link to the page hosted by my link-in-bio/collective domain, [index.adrianne](https://adrianne.me/) on the footer partial
- Also added the **Changelog** link on the footer, right next to the **Privacy Notice** link. This is for the people who are too lazy to go on my repo and want a direct link to the changelog instead

### 🔧 Fixes
- Fixed the Markdown/HTML font-weight code on the **LinkedIn Certifications** box in the `Credentials` page
- Made the site title `Prompted by Adrianne` linkable to the homepage on the navbar partial. Many users tend to click on the site's title/logo to return to the home page, rather than the `Home` link
