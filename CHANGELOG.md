## [2025-08-11] Prompted by Adrianne Site Polish ✨

### Added
- ✅ Added `Work` menu item and moved `Prompt`, `Projects`, and `Playground` as `Work` submenus. The `Work` link is an anchor link, and will be lead to the **Featured Sections** part of the homepage
- ✅ Added `Ethical AI Manifesto` and `Credentials` as submenus of `About`
- ✅ "Back to Prompts" button on single prompt pages (aligned right, styled with emoji, consistent with the rest of the site)
- ✅ Link to full `CHANGELOG.md` in `README.md` instead of duplicate changelog section

### Fixed
- 🎨 Light text color issue on blockquote sections in prompt posts (now properly styled and readable)
- 💅 Removed underline from custom "Back to Prompts" button link

### Improved
- 📐 Ensured layout consistency between Prompt and Projects detail pages
- 🧼 Removed Markdown-generated link from `pba.md` to avoid double-rendered buttons
