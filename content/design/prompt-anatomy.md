## How do I create my prompts with ChatGPT?

I've gotten used to writing text — a lot of text — in full detail. My crazy fangirling over fanfics helped me a lot on how to get into the deepest details.  
But what if you *want* to go deeper in detail... but you're too lazy to do it?

Welcome to **Prompt Anatomy 101**, where I break down how I structure my prompts like a ✨ well-layered bento ✨.

## 🍱 The Anatomy of a Good Prompt

### 🥢 1. Set the Role
> “You are a data analyst who loves cute metaphors...”

Have you played a (j)RPG before? It’s like you commanding your character to do certain actions.

The only difference is that you're *telling* your LLM to do the action by putting it in-character.

Giving ChatGPT a role helps it act with a voice and mindset. It’s like casting your AI actor!

---

### 🍙 2. Give Clear Instructions
> “List 5 reasons why GPT responses can sound generic.”

Be specific, and avoid vague commands like *“analyze”* unless you give it something *to* analyze.  

If the input is weak, the output won’t be strong either.

---

### 🍡 3. Add Flavor (Optional)
> “Make it funny. Add emojis. Use plain language.”

Style and tone help it vibe with *you*.

---

### 🍵 4. Set Output Format
> “Give the response as a markdown table with 3 columns.”

Structure matters when you're trying to copy-paste results into blog posts or scripts!  
Bonus: The AI tends to follow your formatting expectations better when you’re clear.

## 🧂 Bonus Tips

- Use line breaks between sections  
- Use bullets or numbering for steps  
- Ask for examples if stuck  
- You can tell it what *not* to do (“Don’t start with ‘Sure!’” 😤)
