Welcome to Prompted by Adrianne (PbA)! ðŸŒ¸

This is my personal prompt engineering portfolio where I document:
- âœ¨ AI experiments and prompt patterns
- ðŸ“Š Use cases in creative and technical contexts
- ðŸ’– Ethical considerations when working with generative AI

It was built with love using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and styled with [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), featuring a soft pastel theme and kawaii aesthetic to reflect the fun and approachable nature of my work.

More details and development notes to come soon~
