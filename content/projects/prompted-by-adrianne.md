## 🌼 INTRODUCTION

*Prompted by Adrianne* is more than just a personal website — it’s my handcrafted AI prompt engineering portfolio, lovingly built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and styled using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com). This project was designed not only to showcase my work in AI prompting, but also to reflect my creative identity, coding journey, and commitment to ethical, well-documented design.

From layout to content strategy, every part of this site was thoughtfully planned, structured, and implemented — with a sprinkle of ✨ pastel chaos ✨ and lots of late-night debugging. Whether you’re a hiring manager, collaborator, or fellow creator, this page shares a behind-the-scenes look at how it all came together.

## 🎯 PROJECT GOALS

The goal of *Prompted by Adrianne* was to create a dedicated space to document my AI prompt engineering work in a format that’s thoughtful, accessible, and visually reflective of my personality.

Specifically, I aimed to:

- 🧠 **Document prompts like design work** — using case report–style entries to detail prompt goals, strategies, tools, and results.
- 🪄 **Showcase AI-assisted development** — by building the site through iterative prompting and LLM collaboration.
- 🖼️ **Build a visual identity** — that balances clarity with creativity, using a pastel aesthetic and clean typography.
- 📁 **Organize content clearly** — separating prompts, projects, blog posts, and behind-the-scenes updates.
- 📝 **Reflect on AI with a human lens** — through blog entries that explore the ethical, cultural, and personal implications of generative AI.
- ⚙️ **Learn through doing** — applying Hugo and Tailwind CSS in a real-world portfolio, not just as a playground but as a professional foundation.

This project also sets the stage for future use case expansions — and most importantly, gave me a place to call my own on the web.

## 🏗️ DESIGN & STRUCTURE

From the start, I wanted *Prompted by Adrianne* to feel clean, cohesive, and unmistakably “me.” I chose a minimal-but-whimsical layout powered by Hugo and styled with Tailwind CSS, giving me full control over design and structure.

The overall site structure includes:

- 🧵 **Prompts** — individual use cases and experiments, organized as case reports
- 🧪 **Projects** — larger builds, collaborations, and long-form showcases
- 📝 **Blog** — thoughts and reflections on AI culture and tech ethics
- 🛝 **Playground** — fun experiments and mini projects prompted by AI
- 🌸 **About** — an intro to who I am, what I do, and why prompt engineering matters to me
- 💌 **Contact & Colophon** — powered by Formspree and sprinkled with gratitude

Each section lives in its own directory and has a tailored layout. Custom partials and components keep things modular. The emoji headers and pastel background tints create visual consistency while adding personality and mood to each section.

## 🛠️ TECH STACK & TOOLS

Building *Prompted by Adrianne* meant choosing tools that balanced structure and creativity. Here's what made it happen:

- ⚙️ [**Hugo**](https://gohugo.io) — the static site generator powering the entire site
- 🎨 [**Tailwind CSS**](https://tailwindcss.com) — used via CDN for quick and clean utility-first styling
- 🤖 [**ChatGPT**](https://chatgpt.com/) (a.k.a. Ai-sensei) — my collaborative coding buddy and co-writer
- 🧠 [**Notion**](https://www.notion.com/) & [**GoodNotes**](https://www.goodnotes.com/) — for content planning, scribbles, and content drafting
- 💻 [**Visual Studio Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/) — my primary code editor
- 🐙 [**Git**](https://git-scm.com/) & [**GitHub**](https://github.com) — for version control, backups, and deployment prep
- 🪪 [**Formspree**](https://formspree.io/) — to handle Contact form submissions without backend fuss

### 🧰 BONUS TOOLS

- 🖼️ **Procreate** — for custom stickers and visual branding (e.g., Sleepy Cloud-chan ☁️💤)
- ✍️ **iA Writer** — my favorite minimalist Markdown editor (also used for writing fanfic!)
- ☁️ **iCloud** — for syncing content across devices
- 🐤 **Cyberduck** — for FTP transfers to my shared hosting provider
- 🌐 **Hosting.com** — formerly A2 Hosting, this is where the site lives

These tools make up the pastel-coded dream stack that brought this portfolio to life.

## 💖 CLOSING THOUGHTS

*Prompted by Adrianne* is more than a site — it’s a milestone.
