## 🌼 INTRODUCTION

*Prompted by Adrianne* is more than just a personal website — it’s my handcrafted AI prompt engineering portfolio, lovingly built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and styled using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com). This project was designed not only to showcase my work in AI prompting, but also to reflect my creative identity, coding journey, and commitment to ethical, well-documented design.

From layout to content strategy, every part of this site was thoughtfully planned, structured, and implemented — with a sprinkle of ✨ pastel chaos ✨ and lots of late-night debugging. Whether you’re a hiring manager, collaborator, or fellow creator, this page shares a behind-the-scenes look at how it all came together.

## 🎯 PROJECT GOALS

The main goal of *Prompted by Adrianne* was to create a dedicated space to document my AI prompt engineering work in a format that is thoughtful, accessible, and visually reflective of my personality.

Specifically, I aimed to:

- 🧠 **Document prompts like design work** — using case report–style entries to detail prompt goals, strategies, tools, and results.
- 🪄 **Showcase AI-assisted development** — by building the site itself through iterative prompting and LLM collaboration.
- 🖼️ **Build a visual identity** — that balances clarity with creativity, using a pastel aesthetic and clean typography.
- 📁 **Organize content clearly** — separating prompts, projects, blog posts, and behind-the-scenes updates.
- 📝 **Reflect on AI with a human lens** — through blog posts that explore the ethical, cultural, and personal implications of generative AI.
- ⚙️ **Learn through doing** — applying Hugo and Tailwind CSS in a real-world portfolio, not just as an experiment but as a long-term career tool.

This project also sets the foundation for future use case expansions — and most importantly, gave me a place to call my own on the web.

## 🏗️ DESIGN & STRUCTURE

From the start, I wanted *Prompted by Adrianne* to feel clean, cohesive, and undeniably mine. I chose a minimal-but-whimsical layout powered by Hugo and styled with Tailwind CSS, giving me full control over the site’s design and flow.

The overall structure follows a familiar pattern:

- 🧵 **Prompts** — individual use cases and experiments, organized as case reports.
- 🧪 **Projects** — broader builds, collaborations, and long-form showcases.
- 📝 **Blog** — reflections, rants, raves, and reading on AI culture and tech ethics.
- 🛝 **Playground** - side projects and fun stuff prompted with AI.
- 🌸 **About** — a quick introduction to who I am, what I do, and why prompt engineering matters to me.
- 💌 **Contact & Colophon** — powered by Formspree and sprinkled with gratitude.

Each section lives in its own directory with a tailored layout. Custom partials and components make the site modular and easy to extend. The pastel background tints and emoji headers give each section a distinct mood while maintaining consistency across the site.

Everything is handcrafted with a mix of Markdown and magic.

## 💖 CLOSING THOUGHTS

*Prompted by Adrianne* isn’t just a site — it’s a milestone.

It represents everything I’ve been learning about prompt engineering, ethical AI practices, and the delicate balance between creativity and clarity. Building this portfolio helped me grow as a designer, developer, and digital storyteller — all while embracing a sparkly, sometimes-chaotic, always-intentional workflow.

Whether you're an employer, a fellow prompt engineer, or a curious visitor — thank you for taking the time to explore my work. I’m excited to keep learning, building, and prompting new kinds of magic from here on out.

Stay sparkly, stay thoughtful — and prompt with purpose. 💫
