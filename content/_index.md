# ðŸŒ¸ OH-HAI-THERE~!!

Hi, Iâ€™m **Adrianne Padua** â€” an aspiring AI Prompt Engineer, chaos-wrangling creative, problem-solving explorer, and ethical tech fangirl.

This site is my portfolio *and* my AI playground: a cozy, pastel-coded space where I explore prompt design, responsible AI, and the magic of language.  

Whether Iâ€™m building tools, crafting experiments, or just vibing with Victor Mono and Tailwind, everything here is made with curiosity, kindness, and a little glitter. âœ¨

Together with **Ai-sensei**, we'll be venturing into our adventures of prompting and any form of chaos we run into.

Welcome aboard â€” letâ€™s make AI more human(e), one prompt at a time. ðŸ’»ðŸŒ¸
