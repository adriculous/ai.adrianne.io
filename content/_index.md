Hi, Iâ€™m **Adrianne Padua** â€” an aspiring AI Prompt Engineer, chaos-wrangling creative, and ethical tech fangirl.  

This site is my portfolio *and* my AI playground: a cozy, pastel-coded space where I explore prompt design, responsible AI, and the magic of language.  

Whether Iâ€™m building tools, crafting experiments, or just vibing with Victor Mono and Tailwind, everything here is made with curiosity, kindness, and a little glitter. âœ¨

Welcome aboard â€” letâ€™s make AI more human(e), one prompt at a time. ðŸ’»ðŸŒ¸
