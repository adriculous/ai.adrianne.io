## üå∏ Colophon

This site, [Prompted by Adrianne](https://ai.adrianne.io), was handcrafted with love, curiosity, and a bit of monospace magic.

- **FRAMEWORK:** [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) ‚Äî static site generator for the nerdy but impatient.
- **STYLING:** [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) ‚Äî because utility classes are love, utility classes are life.
- **FONT:** [Victor Mono](https://rubjo.github.io/victor-mono/) ‚Äî for that sweet cursive-italic code aesthetic.
- **THEME:** A homemade pastel-cyber hybrid powered by caffeine, chaos, and `overflow-x-hidden`.
- **STICKERS** Ai-sensei ([ChatGPT](https://openai.com)) and me (with [Procreate](https://procreate.com)) üíÖüèª.
- **EDITOR:** Written in [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer), and versioned with [GitHub](https://github.com).
- **HOSTED:** [Hosting.com](https://hosting.com).
- **SOURCE:** [Repo](https://github.com/adriculous/ai.adrianne.io).
