This site was handcrafted with love, curiosity, and a bit of monospace magic.

- **FRAMEWORK:** [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) ‚Äî static site generator for the nerdy but impatient
- **STYLING:** [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) ‚Äî because utility classes are love, utility classes are life
- **FONT:** [Victor Mono](https://rubjo.github.io/victor-mono/) ‚Äî for that sweet cursive-italic code aesthetic. I'm using the [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Victor+Mono) version
- **THEME:** A homemade pastel-cyber hybrid powered by caffeine, chaos, and `overflow-x-hidden`. Not sure what to name it... maybe *PBA Theme ver. 1*?
- **STICKERS:** Ai-sensei ([ChatGPT](https://openai.com)) and me (with [Procreate](https://procreate.com)) üíÖüèª
- **ILLUSTRATIONS & SOZAI:** [Irasutoya](https://irasutoya.com)
- **EDITOR:** Written in [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer), and versioned with [GitHub](https://github.com)
- **HOSTED:** [Netlify](https://netlify.com) *(as of 9/11/2025)*
- **SOURCE:** [Repo](https://github.com/adriculous/ai.adrianne.io)
