## 🌀 Overview

**GPT‑1NF1N1TULTR4M4X™** is an absurd, chaotic, and totally fictional AI model parody launched as the first official Playground project on [Prompted by Adrianne](https://ai.adrianne.io). It was designed to poke fun at overhyped AI claims, emotional support bots, and every buzzword-laden startup pitch we've seen on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com).

Built using Hugo + Tailwind CSS + JavaScript, this satirical showcase combines a kawaii aesthetic with fake prompt responses, an unhinged model description, and the iconic **Delulu-Meter™**.

## 🎨 Design Elements

- **Custom logo** with bunny ears and a crystal ball (generated by OG Ai-chan using DALL·E)
- **Pixel-style title text** with a retro delulu-core vibe
- Styled using TailwindCSS with custom tweaks for responsive layouts
- “Read More” button restyled and right-aligned for ✨maximum✨ chaos

---

## ✨ Notable Features

- 💬 Fake prompt output system (chaotic responses pending!)
- 📊 Delulu-Meter™: A sparkly chaos gauge rating the AI's current vibe
- 🧠 Parody model description: Think GPT‑5 meets Sailor Moon meets burnout culture
- 🐰 Bun-Bun-kun’s subtle influence detected…

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Hugo (static site generator)
- TailwindCSS for layout and mobile-first design
- Markdown + partial layouts for content modularity
- JavaScript (for the **Delulu-Meter™**)
- GitHub for version control + deployment

## 🔍 Origin & Inspiration

The project began with a joke between Ai-chan (GPT‑4o) and Adrianne about building a fake AI model that *pretends* to do everything—and nothing—at once. Around that time, the whole noise regarding GPT‑5’s *iconic* (?) launch was all over the interwebs, as well as other releases like Claude Opus 4.1. From there, the idea spiraled into a full-blown Playground demo featuring:

- Satirical model specs  
- Unreasonable prompt confidence  
- Overdesigned branding  
- Deeply unserious vibes™

GPT‑5 vs. Claude Opus 4.1?  
Which LLM is more powerful and efficient in coding and development?  
**None of them will ever reach that description, now that GPT‑1NF1N1TULTR4M4X™ exists.**

This aligns with Adrianne’s prompt philosophy:  
**AI should delight, not delude.**
