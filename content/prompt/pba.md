## 🧠 INTRODUCTION

Welcome to the inaugural case report of *Prompted by Adrianne*! This pastel-powered portfolio isn’t just a visual treat — it’s a thoughtfully built showcase of my work in prompt engineering, developed from scratch using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), styled with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com), and infused with just the right amount of kawaii chaos.

This site reflects how I approach every project: creative, ethical, and human-centered. I believe the best AI prompts aren’t just functional — they’re purposeful, well-documented, and rooted in clarity and care.

✨ My mission? To build thoughtful, responsible AI experiences — one prompt at a time.

## 🎯 PROMPT GOAL

The goal was simple: build a personal prompt engineering portfolio site that reflects my skills, values, and personality. I wanted a space where I could publish case reports like this one, show off successful prompt experiments, and reflect on ethical AI practices — all in a layout that feels unmistakably *me*.

Beyond showcasing prompts, this project was also my hands-on way of learning Hugo and Tailwind CSS. I chose Hugo for its speed, flexibility, and full creative control, and Tailwind for its utility-first approach. With AI assistance, I tackled both the backend and design — learning by doing, one pastel-colored `div` at a time.

## 🧩 PROMPT STRATEGY

This project began with a prompt that wasn’t typed into a chatbot, but one I posed to myself:

*“How do I design a portfolio that doesn’t just show what I can do — but how I think, how I work, and who I am as a prompt engineer?”*

The strategic goal was to frame the site itself as a living prompt. Every element — from the layout structure to the metadata of each post — had to reflect my emphasis on clarity, creativity, and care in prompt engineering.

A portfolio shouldn’t just display what you’ve built — it should also reflect who you are as its builder.

With *Prompted by Adrianne*, I didn’t just want to share successful prompts. I wanted every page, every pastel box, and every emoji-laced metadata field to say, “This is my voice. This is how I create.” The strategy was never just to impress — it was to express.

## 🛠️ PROMPT TECHNIQUES

I approached this site as if I were crafting a multi-step AI prompt, with each section serving as its own instruction or modifier. Just like a good prompt, the site needed:

- **Clear structure**: Pages like *Prompts*, *Projects*, *Blog*, and *Playground* are broken out cleanly with consistent front matter templates and semantic layouts.
- **Embedded metadata**: Tags, categories, last updated dates, and author notes help contextualize the content — like prompt modifiers for better outputs.
- **Intentional language**: Button text, page titles, and even emoji choices are carefully selected to reinforce the voice and tone of the site (professional but warm, technical but fun).
- **Fallbacks and edge handling**: When posts don’t have featured images, a pastel-toned “LDN mode” fallback kicks in — inspired by graceful fallback design in prompt chaining.

Every design and development choice mirrored what I value in prompt engineering: clarity, readability, personality, and adaptability.

## 🧰 TOOLS USED

Here’s the stack that powered *Prompted by Adrianne* from dream to deploy:

- **Hugo**: The heart of the site. Its fast static generation, flexible content system, and theming options gave me full creative control.
- **Tailwind CSS**: My styling weapon of choice. I’m still learning it, but building *Prompted by Adrianne* helped me practice using utility classes to craft layouts and responsive styles on the fly.
- **Markdown**: Every post and case report is written in clean, readable Markdown — often with ✨ emoji ✨ to help express tone.
- **ChatGPT**: Used as an AI assistant to guide the technical setup, write scaffolding code, brainstorm design choices, and — yes — help write and refine the prompts behind this very portfolio.
- **VS Code + iA Writer**: VS Code for development and previewing locally, iA Writer for distraction-free writing and syncing drafts via iCloud.
- **Git + GitHub**: Version control is a must! I used Git to manage my changes and GitHub to back up and track progress.
- **Cyberduck**: For good ol’ fashioned FTP uploads to my web host (throwback vibes!).

I intentionally avoided heavy CMSs or overcomplicated frameworks to keep the build fast, lightweight, and fully transparent.

## 📈 RESULTS

*Prompted by Adrianne* successfully launched as a functional and stylistically unique AI prompt engineering portfolio. The final site achieves the following outcomes:

- ✅ **Clear content structure** — with dedicated sections for prompts, projects, blog posts, and contact information.
- 🎀 **Consistent pastel theme** — aligned with my personal branding while showcasing CSS customization using Tailwind.
- 🧠 **Prompt documentation** — each Case Report is structured to clearly present goals, strategy, tools, and outcomes — ideal for employers or collaborators seeking thoughtful, ethical prompt work.
- ⚡️ **Lightweight and fast** — built with Hugo’s static generation for optimized performance and quick deployment.
- 🌐 **Deployed on custom domain** — available live [here](https://ai.adrianne.io), complete with responsive layouts and mobile support.
- 🤝 **Built with AI collaboration** — the entire process was co-developed using LLM assistance, showcasing prompt iteration, context management, and ethical tool usage in action.

This project not only helped me build a public portfolio — it also sharpened my ability to treat prompting as design, development, and documentation practice in one cohesive workflow.

## ⚠️ CHALLENGES

Building *Prompted by Adrianne* wasn’t always magical sparkles and seamless styling. Several challenges emerged during development, especially as someone still learning Hugo, Tailwind CSS, and Git/GitHub workflows:

- 🧩 **Hugo’s learning curve** — Hugo’s power comes with complexity. Layout inheritance, partials, and front matter behavior took time to fully grasp, especially when templates refused to render the way I expected.
- 🎨 **Tailwind trial and error** — Utility-first styling meant endless class tweaking. Spacing, colors, and responsive design became a jigsaw puzzle that broke layouts at the slightest misstep.
- 🔁 **Git/GitHub jitters** — Version control saved the project more than once, but using Git from Terminal felt like typing into the abyss. I had to triple-check commit commands and manually back up changes when I got too nervous to push.
- 🧠 **Information overload** — Between Hugo docs, Tailwind docs, and AI-generated suggestions, I sometimes ended up more confused than helped. Debugging meant cross-checking outdated advice and experimenting until it *just worked™*.
- 🐛 **Fragile layouts** — Even a missing closing tag or rogue class name in `baseof.html` or `single.html` could nuke the whole layout. There were… many resets. Many tears. Much “WAAAAAH.”
- 🌀 **Feature creep temptation** — With a thousand design ideas, it was easy to stray from core functionality. I had to keep reminding myself: this is a portfolio, not a galaxy-brained full-stack app.
- ⏰ **Balancing real-life responsibilities** — Juggling daily responsibilities and limited free time meant progress came in bursts. I had to stay flexible, focused, and patient as I slowly brought the project to life.
- 🧭 **Site planning and structure** — Deciding on sections, naming conventions, and folder hierarchies for prompts, blog posts, and projects required multiple rounds of brainstorming (and occasional existential dread).

Despite the hiccups, every bug squashed and every layout fixed deepened my understanding of prompt engineering and web development. This project was as much about growth as it was about presentation.

## 🧋 TAKEAWAYS

Here’s what I learned while building *Prompted by Adrianne*:

- 🧩 **Prompt engineering isn’t just input/output** — it’s UX, documentation, and iterative design.
- 🛠️ **AI-assisted development accelerates learning** — but you still need to direct and debug with human intent.
- 🎨 **A portfolio should reflect your identity** — not just your skills. A little kawaii chaos goes a long way!
- ⚠️ **Technical clarity matters** — from directory structures to layout templating, small errors can snowball fast.
- 🧯 **Back up before you push** — always save a copy of your site locally (or to a flash/external drive) before committing to GitHub. Trust me. Just do it.
- ⏳ **Version control is your best friend** — especially when Hugo throws a tantrum and eats your layout 😭
- 🧘🏻‍♀️ **Scheduling matters** — finding the right time to focus on a project (especially around work or chores) is key to sustainable progress and avoiding burnout.
- ✍🏻 **Take notes often** — whether it’s a spark of inspiration or a bug fix, jot it down! Use a physical notebook, Notion, Goodnotes, or whatever helps you track your ideas and decisions.

Above all: this project reinforced the power of building in public, treating prompting as craft, and owning your growth — typos, tears, tailwinds, and all.

## 🌸 REFLECTIONS & NEXT STEPS

Creating Prompted by Adrianne was more than just building a portfolio — it was a challenge in self-trust, creative experimentation, and technical growth. From learning Hugo’s templating logic to styling layouts with Tailwind classes (and occasionally breaking the whole site 😭), every step pushed me out of my comfort zone in the best way possible.

This wasn’t just a site build. It was a statement of identity: that prompt engineering isn’t just utility — it’s communication, design, and documentation in harmony. I now have a foundation that represents my skills, values, and potential, with a space I can continuously evolve.

### ✨ Next Up:

- Write and publish more **Case Reports** to build a strong prompt archive
- Polish **Projects** and document AI-assisted work beyond prompts
- Publish BTS-style **Blog Posts** to reflect on what I’ve learned (and the chaos along the way)
- And eventually… make *Prompted by Adrianne* job-ready for roles in ethical AI, prompt design, or AI-enabled development

With one project finished, I’m even more excited for what comes next.
