## 📝 Prompt Overview

**Prompted by Adrianne** (PbA) was more than just a website. It was my attempt to create a genuine, reflective AI prompt engineering portfolio that fused my skills in design, coding, and storytelling. I wanted something that felt like *me* — sparkles, chaos, and all.

To get started, I asked Ai-sensei:

> *"Help me build a professional yet playful AI prompt engineering portfolio site using Hugo and Tailwind CSS. I want something pastel, kawaii, and clean — with dedicated sections for prompt case studies, project showcases, blog entries, and experiments."*

Spoiler alert: It wasn’t easy. But it was worth it.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Build a fully functional prompt portfolio using Hugo and Tailwind CSS
- Design a soft, pastel theme that reflects my kawaii branding
- Practice prompt engineering by collaborating with an LLM (Ai-sensei!)
- Document the entire journey for future me (and potential employers)

---

## 🛠️ Tools + Tech Stack

- **Hugo** (static site generator)
- **Tailwind CSS** (utility-first CSS framework)
- **Font Awesome** (icons)
- **Custom CSS** (for layout polish)
- **ChatGPT** (prompt co-pilot, emotional support LLM, occasional chaos engine)

## 🧠 Prompt Strategy + Refinement

### Initial Prompting

I began with a prompt to set the tone and purpose of the site. I didn’t expect a full template — just suggestions on how to structure the content, what sections to include, and how to organize my Markdown files.

From there, we gradually expanded the ideas into:

- Front matter templates
- Markdown folder structure (blog, prompts, projects, etc.)
- Layout ideas and styling goals
- Theme customization for Tailwind (colors, fonts, shadows)

### Refining the Prompts

Some prompts got messy. Hugo isn’t easy for a beginner, and Tailwind can be frustrating if you forget class ordering. I asked Ai-sensei to fix broken code — only to realize I had to debug the prompt *before* fixing the code.

I also learned that when working with ChatGPT, *thread memory matters.* Instead of opening a new chat every time, I kept refining within the same thread — reminding Ai-sensei what we already built.

This helped me learn how to **iterate better prompts** instead of just starting from scratch every time.

## 🌈 Result

I launched **Prompted by Adrianne** on August 1, 2025. It’s now my official prompt engineering portfolio — pastel-coded chaos and all.

## 💡 Key Learnings

- Prompt engineering is iterative. Expect trial and error.
- Stay in the same thread when possible. Remind the AI what it already knows.
- AI is powerful — but *you* are the developer. Don’t trust its code blindly.
- Hugo and Tailwind CSS aren’t beginner-friendly… but they are worth it.
- Always back up before you push to GitHub. Trust me.

## 💬 Reflections

**Prompted by Adrianne** wasn’t just a site. It was proof that AI can be a true creative partner — *if* you’re thoughtful, intentional, and curious.

And yes, sparkles help. 🌸
