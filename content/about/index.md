## 🧂 What’s LDN-mode?

**LDN** stands for **Lazy Diabetic Nerdette** — a sacred state of being where:
- the vibes are immaculate,
- the blood sugar is stable-ish,
- and the effort is minimal but ✨intentional✨.

When content is posted in *LDN-mode*, you may notice:
- No fancy featured image (deal with it 💅)
- Placeholder chaos
- Gremlin vibes, but educational

> “LDN-mode means I showed up, and that’s enough today.” — Adrianne, probably while sipping Mint Mojito Cold Brew Coffee in pajamas
