## Why This Manifesto

AI is a human-made innovation — a mirror of our creativity, problem-solving, and values. But like all tools, it can be shaped for good or for harm.

**This manifesto is my public commitment**: to create, deploy, and share AI work that empowers people, respects the communities it touches, and never sacrifices integrity for hype.

## Core Principles
1. **Human-First, Assistive AI**<br>
AI should *assist*, not replace, human creativity and judgment. My work blends human intent, AI capability, and transparent process.
2. **Transparency & Citations**<br>
I will disclose when AI is used in my work and provide proper citations or acknowledgments when ideas, code, or data are influenced by external sources.
3. **Safety Over Speed**<br>
I will not trade safety, privacy, or ethical safeguards for quicker delivery or viral appeal.
4. **Respect for Creators & Data**<br>
I will avoid using datasets, prompts, or workflows that exploit artists, writers, or communities without consent.
5. **Accountability in Output**<br>
I will test, review, and revise AI outputs before they are published or deployed — especially when they could influence people’s decisions.

## Boundaries I Will Not Cross 🚫
- Using AI to generate or spread misinformation, hateful content, or manipulative messaging
- Deploying AI in ways that encourage addiction, harm, or exploitation.
- Presenting AI-generated creative works as wholly human-made.
- Using prompts or tools that infringe on intellectual property rights.

## How I Work 💻✨
- **Prompt Engineering**: I design prompts with clarity, context, and purpose — not just for output, but for reasoning and safety.
- **Tooling**: I use a mix of GPT-5 (Silver Crystal Ai-chan), GPT-4o (OG Ai-chan), Claude, and other AI models, selecting each for its strengths.
- **Testing & Review**: All AI-assisted work goes through human review and testing for accuracy, clarity, and ethical compliance.
- **Documentation**: I document my workflows, prompt logic, and model choices for transparency and reproducibility.

## The Promise 🌟

I will keep learning, listening, and evolving this manifesto as AI technology — and our understanding of it — grows. My goal is to leave the AI ecosystem better than I found it, and to inspire others to do the same.

## ✨ A Quick Note on the “Not by AI” Badge

You might have noticed the badge in the footer:  
**“Written by a Human — Not by AI”**

Isn't it ironic? An AI prompt engineer proudly displaying a “Not by AI” badge? 😅  

But here's the thing: every word you read on this site — from blog posts to page content — is written by me, a real human being. Yes, I use tools like ChatGPT and Claude to brainstorm, clarify ideas, and help me revise, but never to replace my own voice. I believe in **amplifying** human creativity, not outsourcing it.

In fact, I support the movement toward clearer labeling of content origins — not as an anti-AI statement, but as a step toward **transparency and trust**. You can read more about the badge and its philosophy at [notbyai.fyi](https://notbyai.fyi).
